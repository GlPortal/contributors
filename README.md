# contributors
It is hard to keep track of all the awesome contributors. This file is trying to keep track of some of the most important milestones connecting them to the people which created them.

Saved the code from becoming obsolete by porting the whole code base to modern OpenGL basically rewriting the whole engine core.

## Juraj 
Got the blender plugin from a proof of concept to a usable state. Started work on a js scripting engine for GlPortal.
